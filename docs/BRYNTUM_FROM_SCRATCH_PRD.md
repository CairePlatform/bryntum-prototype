# Bryntum From Scratch PRD – For External Consultants

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** 2025-12-15  
**Purpose:** Request for Quote (RFQ) for building Bryntum SchedulerPro UI from scratch  
**Target Audience:** Ballistix Consultants (Professional Bryntum Developers)

---

## Executive Summary

Caire is a home-care scheduling platform that requires a professional scheduling calendar UI built with Bryntum SchedulerPro. We need experienced Bryntum developers to build this **from scratch**, following best practices and Bryntum's recommended patterns.

**Scope:**

1. **Build Bryntum SchedulerPro UI** from scratch using official Bryntum examples as reference
2. **Connect to GraphQL backend API** (to be provided during project)
3. **Implement data transformation** between backend format and Bryntum format
4. **Ensure all features work with production data**

**Key Requirement:** Build a production-ready, maintainable solution using Bryntum's recommended patterns and examples. This is a **greenfield build**, not an integration of existing code.

**Timeline Estimate:** 14-19 working days (112-152 hours) - See `bryntum_timeplan.md` for detailed breakdown.

**Note:** If you have an existing prototype, see `BRYNTUM_PROTOTYPE_INTEGRATION_PRD.md` for a faster integration approach (22-33 hours).

**Note:**

- Backend API specifications and requirements are provided in a separate document (`BRYNTUM_BACKEND_SPEC.md`) that can be attached for reference.
- **Alternative Approach:** If you have an existing working prototype, see `BRYNTUM_PROTOTYPE_INTEGRATION_PRD.md` for a faster integration approach (22-33 hours vs 112-152 hours).

#### Core Concepts

**Pre-Planning:** Process of planning recurring visits across multiple weeks/months before they enter daily scheduling. Allows finding optimal patterns (day-of-week, time-of-day) for recurring visits.

**Movable Visit:** A recurring visit with flexible time window (e.g., "weekly, any day 8 AM-12 PM") that can be optimized to find best placement.

**Pinned Visit:** Fixed time, duration, and caregiver (🔒 icon, solid background). Cannot move unless explicitly unlocked. Represents stable recurring patterns (slingor).

**Unpinned Visit:** Movable within allowed window (dashed border). Can be moved by optimizer or user. Used for new clients and flexible tasks.

**Time Horizon:** Planning period (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, custom) for pre-planning optimization.

**Unused Hours:** Client allocation hours that were not utilized (monthly allocation - actual service hours delivered). If a client has 100h total allowed visits per month and 5h are cancelled (by client or by org if optional visit during supply limitation), the unused hours = 5h. These unused hours can be recaptured when we have excess staff capacity.

**Supply/Demand Balance:** Comparison of available employee capacity (supply) vs required visit hours (demand) across time horizon.

#### Features Required

  - Unassigned visits: Shown in panel, not on calendar until placed
- **Supply/Demand Dashboard:** Panel showing capacity vs demand metrics
  - Total supply hours (all employees)
  - Total demand hours (all visits)
  - Balance (supply - demand)
  - Utilization percentage
  - Color-coded indicators (green: balanced 75-85%, yellow: <75%, red: >90%)

  - Total unused hours across horizon (sum of all clients' unused allocation)
  - Per-client breakdown (which clients have unused allocation)

  4. User runs pre-planning optimization
  5. Optimizer inserts new visits around pinned patterns (doesn't disrupt existing)
  6. User reviews optimized schedule with diff view
  7. User accepts and pins approved visits
  8. Pinned visits become part of slingor (recurring patterns)
- **Visual Feedback:**
  - New visits shown as unpinned (dashed border) until accepted
  - After pinning: Become solid blue with 🔒 icon
  - Existing pinned visits remain unchanged (solid blue, locked)

#### GraphQL Operations Required

- `supplyDemandBalance(timeHorizon)` - Get supply/demand metrics
- `demandCurve(timeHorizon)` - Get demand trend data
- `unusedHours(timeHorizon)` - Get unused hours analysis
- `getOptimalPlacementRecommendations(visitInput)` - Get AI recommendations

**Mutations:**

#### Bryntum Configuration Examples

**Consolidated Schedule View:**

```javascript
{
  viewPreset: 'weekAndMonth', // Multi-week view
  startDate: planningWindowStart,
  endDate: planningWindowEnd,
  resources: employees, // All employees
  events: allVisits, // Pinned + unpinned
  features: {
    eventTooltip: true,
    eventEdit: true,
    drag: {
      constrainDragToResource: false, // Allow moving between weeks
    },
    timeRanges: {
      // Show periods where unused client allocation could be recaptured
      data: unusedAllocationPeriods.map(period => ({
        resourceId: period.employeeId,
        startDate: period.startTime,
        endDate: period.endTime,
        name: `Unused allocation: ${period.hours}h`,
        cls: 'unused-allocation-period',
      })),
    },
  },
  columns: [
    { text: 'Employee', field: 'name', width: 150 },
    {
      text: 'Unused Allocation',
      field: 'unusedHours',
      width: 120,
      renderer: ({ record }) => {
        const hours = record.unusedHours || 0; // Client's unused allocation hours
        const color = hours > 5 ? 'red' : hours > 2 ? 'orange' : 'green';
        return `<span style="color: ${color}">${hours.toFixed(1)}h</span>`;
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

**Pinned vs Unpinned Styling:**

```javascript
eventRenderer: ({ eventRecord }) => {
  const isPinned = eventRecord.pinned;
  return {
    style: isPinned
      ? "background: #3b82f6; color: white;" // Solid blue for pinned
      : "border: 2px dashed #10b981; background: white;", // Dashed green for unpinned
    icon: isPinned ? "🔒" : "", // Lock icon for pinned
  };
