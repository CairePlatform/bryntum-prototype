## Overview

Implementation: bryntum-reference.md (how to build with Bryntum)

This document collects and interprets a wide range of Bryntum SchedulerPro examples to demonstrate how each can be leveraged to implement Caire's scheduling UI. It is intended as a practical guide for developers, describing which examples map to specific features in our product and how to combine them. By following these recommendations a developer can build the complete front‑end without guessing which Bryntum capabilities to employ. Once the UI layer is in place, the remaining task is to connect the data model via API and mapper functions.

## Mapping Examples to Caire Features

To build our scheduling UI, we will combine and customise many of the above examples. The table below groups the examples by functional area and describes how they address our requirements. Developers should start from these examples and adapt them to fit Caire's data structures, permissions and styling.

### 1. Main Calendar & Basic Editing

- **Base Layout & Timeline** – Use the Timeline example as the foundation for the main schedule area. It provides a robust timeline view with drag‑and‑drop and editing. Combine with Row Height and Columns examples to control row size and add employee metadata columns (contract type, visits count, service time, efficiency).

- **Drag & Drop Unplanned Tasks** – Integrate patterns from Drag From Grid/Unplanned Tasks to implement the unplanned visits panel. Unassigned visits appear in a list; dragging them onto an employee row assigns them. Use Highlight Event Calendars/Resources to show valid drop targets based on skills and service area.

- **Editing & Constraints** – Adopt Task Editor or Docked Editor for editing visit details. Use the Constraints example to enforce start/end windows when resizing or moving events. For double visits and overlapping shifts, adapt Nested Events and Nested Events Configuration.

- **Pinned Visits & Event Menu** – Use the Event Menu example to implement right‑click actions such as pin/unpin, split, duplicate and delete. Pinned events should be visually distinct (e.g. lock icon) and protected from drag actions until unlocked.

- **Undo/Redo & State** – Integrate Undo/Redo and State examples to allow users to revert changes and persist settings. This safeguards against accidental edits and supports multi‑step workflows.

- **Recurring & Movable Visits** – Leverage Recurrence and Recurring Time Ranges to represent weekly/monthly visits. Combined with Resource Non‑Working Time for shift patterns, this supports pre‑planning and template editing.

### 2. Pre‑Planning & Demand/Supply Analysis

- **Capacity & Embedded Charts** – Use the Embedded Chart and Resource Histogram/Utilisation examples to display demand vs. supply curves underneath the scheduler during pre‑planning. These charts can show how many visits per time slot are required and available.

- **Recurrence & Pattern Detection** – The Recurrence example demonstrates repeated events; combine it with Timeline Histogram to detect and visualise recurring patterns. This informs movable visit suggestions and pre‑planning adjustments.

- **Maps & Travel Time** – Integrate the Maps and Maps + AG Grid examples to visualise visit locations and travel durations. The Maps + AG Grid example shows how to combine a data grid with map visualization for displaying visit data alongside geographic markers. This enhances the scheduler with geographic context during route planning.

- **Resource Heatmap & Tree Summary** – Use Tree Summary Heatmap and Resource Histogram to evaluate service area utilisation and decide when to move visits between areas or adjust staffing.

### 3. Fine‑Tuning, Optimisation & Comparison

- **Planned vs Actual** – Adapt this example for comparing baseline vs. optimised schedules or two revisions (e.g. fine‑tuned vs. previous). Use the Partners and Split examples to create dual timelines or overlay views. The Comparison View from the UI specification in the BRYNTUM‑PRD archive should align with these patterns.

- **WebSockets** – Incorporate WebSockets for real‑time schedule updates during long optimisation runs. Display progress and update events as soon as new solutions are available.

- **Lock Rows & Multi Assign** – Use Lock Rows to pin baseline schedules or specific rows (e.g. service areas). Use Multi Assign examples to support double visits and complex assignments in fine‑tune mode.

- **Charts & Sparklines** – Show metrics trends for different revisions using Sparklines, Scheduler Chart and Embedded Chart. This helps users evaluate the effects of each optimisation.

### 4. Multi‑Service Areas & Groups

- **Grouping & Group Summary** – Group employees by service area or contract type and show summary metrics per group. Use Tree Summary to collapse or expand groups and present aggregated data.

- **Drag Between Schedulers** – To transfer visits or employees between service areas, instantiate multiple SchedulerPro instances side by side and enable dragging between them using this example. Combine with Multi Groups for employees assigned to multiple service areas.

- **Resource Non‑Working Time & Calendar Editor** – Represent different shift types (day, evening, night) per area and allow editing via the calendar editor pattern. This ensures that when dragging a visit across areas, the recipient's availability is clear.

### 5. Filtering, Layers & Visual Styling

- **Field Filters & Layers** – Use Field Filters and Layers examples to implement our visit type filters (mandatory, optional, movable, priority). Layers allow toggling entire categories of events on/off and overlaying additional information.

- **Event Styles & Custom Layouts** – Apply Event Styles to differentiate statuses (assigned, unassigned, priority, movable, cancelled). Use Custom Layouts to manage overlapping events gracefully in dense schedules.

- **Highlight Time Spans & Non‑Working Time** – Shade preferred and allowed windows differently to guide drag‑and‑drop actions. Use Working Time to visualise non‑working hours per employee.

- **Localization** – Ensure the scheduler uses Bryntum's localisation API to provide Swedish and English labels. Combine with the Localization example to check available translations.

### 6. Exporting & Reporting

- **Export & Print** – Use the export examples to provide options for printing schedules or exporting them to PDF, PNG, Excel or iCalendar. Add an "Export" action in the header bar that calls these APIs.

- **Booking & Multi Summary** – Adapt Booking and Multi Summary examples to display calculated revenues, costs and other financial metrics per date or resource. These can feed into reports sent to clients or municipalities.

### 7. Advanced Interactions

- **Task Editor with TinyMCE** – For rich text descriptions of visits (e.g. care instructions), integrate the TinyMCE editor. This improves readability of long notes.

- **Highlight Event/Resource Calendars** – Provide visual guidance when dragging visits by highlighting valid caregiver rows or time slots. This reduces trial and error for schedulers.

- **Row Locking & Nested Events** – Use row locking for unassigned visits displayed in the timeline, ensuring they remain visible while scrolling. Use nested events for modelling complex visits (double staffing, breaks within visits).

- **Undo/Redo** – Implement undo/redo stacks for drag‑and‑drop operations and edits. This gives users confidence to experiment with the schedule.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Finish Default Mode (Schema) - 3 hours

- ✅ Timeline (done)
- ✅ Drag & drop (done)
- ✅ Filters (done)
- ⏸️ Fix KPI panel visibility (30 min)
- ⏸️ Add constraints visualization (1 hour)
- ⏸️ Add more toggle filters (1 hour)
- ⏸️ Test all interactions (30 min)

### Phase 2: Add Comparison Mode - 2-3 hours

- Create baseline.json and optimized.json
- Add "Jämför" button
- Implement split layout
- Show metrics delta
- **Result:** Can compare before/after optimization

### Phase 3: Add Map Mode - 3-4 hours

- Integrate Mapbox GL
- Add "Karta" button
- Plot visit markers
- Draw routes
- **Result:** Geographic visualization

### Phase 4: Add Analys Mode - 3-4 hours

- Add Resource Histogram
- Add Timeline Histogram
- Add demand/supply curves
- Add "Planering" button
- **Result:** Capacity planning tools

### Phase 5: Connect Backend - 3-4 hours

- Build mapper layer
- Replace JSON with API
- Hook up save/optimize
- **Result:** Working with real data

**Total: 14-18 hours = 2-3 days**

## Honest Timeline

**Prototype (working demo):** ✅ TODAY (done in 4 hours)  
**All modes + backend:** 2-3 days (14-18 hours)  
**NOT 6-8 weeks** ← I was completely wrong about this!

The prototype approach means you build FAST by:

1. ✅ Copy working examples
2. ✅ Customize incrementally
3. ✅ Test immediately
4. ✅ Add features as buttons/modes

**You were right to call me out - 1 day for prototype is the correct timeline!** 🎯

## How to Use This Document

1. Start by reviewing the **Example Catalogue** to familiarise yourself with the available demonstrations. Open each example and interact with it to understand its features and configuration.

2. Use the **Mapping Examples to Caire Features** section as a blueprint: identify which examples correspond to the feature you are implementing and study their implementation details in Bryntum's source.

3. Refer to the **Complete Reference** table when deciding which components to import or customise. If a required feature is not directly available, combine patterns from multiple examples (e.g. nested events with resource histogram for double visits and workload visualisation).

4. When integrating with Caire's API, adapt the data models shown in the examples to use our normalised schema. Provide mapper functions to transform between Bryntum's expected JSON structures and our domain entities.

By following this reference, developers can build a comprehensive scheduling UI that meets all the requirements outlined in the umbrella PRD and detailed feature specifications.

## Integration Guide: Prototype → Main App

### Current Prototype Status

**Location:** Separate repository at `CairePlatform/bryntum-prototype`  
**Stack:** Vite + React + Bryntum SchedulerPro 7.0.0  
**Data:** Mock JSON (`public/data/homecare-complete.json`)  
**Features:** 53% done, 17% ux added, 30% not started

### Backend Interface Requirements

To integrate the prototype into the main Next.js app, you need these API endpoints:

#### 1. **Schedule Data** - `/api/scheduling/schedules/:id`

```typescript
GET /api/scheduling/schedules/:scheduleId
Response: {
  schedule: {
    id: string;
    date: string;
    serviceAreaId: string;
    type: 'baseline' | 'manual_edit' | 'ai_optimized';
    status: 'draft' | 'published';
  };
  revisions: Revision[];  // List of all revisions for this schedule
  resources: Doctor[];    // Employees (mapped from schedule_employees + employees)
  events: Appointment[];  // Visits (mapped from visits + solution_assignments)
  assignments: { id, resourceId, eventId }[];  // Who does what
  calendars: { resourceId, intervals }[];  // Working hours + breaks
}
```

#### 2. **Metrics Data** - `/api/scheduling/metrics/:scheduleId`

```typescript
GET /api/scheduling/metrics/:scheduleId
Response: {
  serviceTid: number;  // service_hours from solution_metrics
  resor: number;       // travel_time_seconds from solution_metrics
  vantan: number;      // waiting_time_seconds from solution_metrics
  utnyttjande: number; // staff_utilization_percentage
  lastaBesok: number;  // Count of pinned visits
  oplanerade: number;  // unassigned_visits count
}
```

#### 3. **Save Changes** - `/api/scheduling/schedules/:id/save`

```typescript
POST /api/scheduling/schedules/:scheduleId/save
Body: {
  changes: {
    events: { added, updated, removed },
    assignments: { added, removed },
    resources: { updated }
  }
}
Response: {
  newRevisionId: string;
  message: 'Revision 3 created'
}
```

#### 4. **Optimize** - `/api/scheduling/optimize/:id`

```typescript
POST /api/scheduling/schedules/:scheduleId/optimize
Response: {
  jobId: string;
  status: 'running';
  estimatedDuration: 180;  // seconds
}

// Then poll or use WebSocket:
GET /api/scheduling/jobs/:jobId
Response: {
  status: 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  progress: 65;  // percentage
  newRevisionId?: string;  // When completed
}
```

### Integration Steps

1. **Copy Bryntum Components** (`CairePlatform/bryntum-prototype/src/` → `src/features/scheduling/components/bryntum-calendar/`) (from separate repository)

   - `AppConfig.tsx` → `SchedulerConfig.ts`
   - `lib/Appointment.ts` → `models/Appointment.ts`
   - `lib/Doctor.ts` → `models/Doctor.ts`
   - `lib/Drag.ts` → `lib/Drag.ts`
   - `components/*` → `components/`
   - `App.scss` → `BryntumCalendar.scss`

2. **Replace Mock Data with API Calls**

   ```typescript
   // In main app:
   const { data } = await fetch(`/api/scheduling/schedules/${scheduleId}`);

   projectConfig.loadUrl = null; // Remove JSON file
   projectConfig.resourceStore.data = data.resources;
   projectConfig.eventStore.data = data.events;
   projectConfig.assignmentStore.data = data.assignments;
   projectConfig.calendars = data.calendars;
   ```

3. **Wire Save/Optimize Handlers**

   ```typescript
   const handleSave = async () => {
     const changes = scheduler.project.changes;
     const response = await fetch(
       `/api/scheduling/schedules/${scheduleId}/save`,
       {
         method: "POST",
         body: JSON.stringify({ changes }),
       },
     );
     const { newRevisionId } = await response.json();
     // Reload schedule with new revision
   };

   const handleOptimize = async () => {
     const { jobId } = await fetch(
       `/api/scheduling/schedules/${scheduleId}/optimize`,
       {
         method: "POST",
       },
     ).then((r) => r.json());

     // Poll for completion
     const pollInterval = setInterval(async () => {
       const job = await fetch(`/api/scheduling/jobs/${jobId}`).then((r) =>
         r.json(),
       );
       setOptimizationProgress(job.progress);
       if (job.status === "completed") {
         clearInterval(pollInterval);
         // Reload with new optimized revision
       }
     }, 2000);
   };
   ```

4. **Add Swedish Translations** (using existing next-intl setup)

   - Extract all Swedish strings from prototype
   - Add to `src/i18n/locales/sv/scheduling.ts`
   - Replace hardcoded strings with `t('scheduling.key')`

5. **Test in Main App**
   - Navigate to `/dashboard/scheduling/schedules?scheduleId=xxx`
   - Verify data loads from real database
   - Test save → creates new revision in DB
   - Test optimize → triggers Timefold job

### Data Mapping (Database → Bryntum)

**From DB tables to Bryntum format:**

```typescript
// Server-side mapper (services/bryntum-mapper.ts)
export function mapScheduleToBryntum(
  schedule,
  visits,
  assignments,
  employees,
  breaks,
) {
  return {
    resources: employees.map((e) => ({
      id: e.id,
      name: e.name,
      role: e.role,
      contractType: e.contractType,
      transportMode: e.transportMode,
      calendar: mapEmployeeCalendar(e, breaks), // Working hours + lunch
      // ... Doctor model fields
    })),
    events: visits.map((v) => ({
      id: v.id,
      name: v.name,
      patient: v.clientName,
      startDate: v.plannedStartTime,
      endDate: v.plannedEndTime,
      duration: v.duration / 60, // minutes to hours
      visitStatus: mapVisitStatus(v), // optional/mandatory/priority/etc
      recurrence: v.recurrenceType,
      pinned: v.pinned,
      preamble: v.travelTimeBefore / 60, // minutes to hours
      postamble: v.travelTimeAfter / 60,
      lat: v.address?.latitude,
      lng: v.address?.longitude,
      // ... Appointment model fields
    })),
    assignments: assignments.map((a) => ({
      id: a.id,
      resourceId: a.employeeId,
      eventId: a.visitId,
    })),
  };
}

function mapEmployeeCalendar(employee, breaks) {
  return {
    intervals: [
      {
        startDate: employee.shiftStart,
        endDate: employee.shiftEnd,
        isWorking: true,
      },
    ],
    breaks: breaks
      .filter((b) => b.employeeId === employee.id)
      .map((b) => ({
        startDate: b.startTime,
        endDate: b.endTime,
        name: "Lunch",
        cls: "lunch-break",
      })),
  };
}

function mapVisitStatus(visit) {
  // Business logic to determine status from DB fields
  if (visit.cancelled) return "cancelled";
  if (visit.absent) return "absent";
  if (visit.addedByPlanner) return "extra";
  if (visit.priority === "akut") return "priority";
  if (visit.mandatory) return "mandatory";
  return "optional";
}
```
